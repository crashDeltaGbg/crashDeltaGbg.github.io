		<h1>about me</h1>
		<p>
			Who am I? I was born in 1977 in Gothenburg, Sweden. My life would've
			probably been a lot easier if I was actually interested in money, but I'm
			not. We have the time granted us between birth and death, and we never
			know beforehand how much time that is. The quality of our life can only be
			measured by what we use our time for and whom we spend it with, and no
			money in the world can compensate for wasting time on doing something we
			don't enjoy with people we don't care for.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, I suppose it's safe to say I'm not much of a businessman. I work best
			in a team, and I prefer not to work alone. Although I can absolutely
			appreciate manual labour, I'm much better suited for intellectual and
			creative work.
